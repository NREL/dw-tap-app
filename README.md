## DW TAP - Computational Framework Demonstration App

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) web application designed to demonstrate common use cases of the DW TAP Computational Framework and API.

### About DW TAP

The Tools Asessing Performance (TAP) project aims to improve wind resource assessment so distributed wind system developers can better predict turbine performance -- enabling wind turbines to become a more economically viable and reliable distributed energy resource. More information can be found in this [fact sheet](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/02/f72/tap-fact-sheet_0.pdf).

### Setup

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app and makes use of the following libraries:

  * React
  * Leaflet
  * Material UI

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
